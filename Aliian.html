                This name had two places within the code of SSBB, as 'Aliian' and 'Aliians'. Its name in japanese is 'Arrians',
                so nothing can really be gleamed from that. Due to its position among the other enemies, it's possible that Aliian
                is the original name for the story mode's most common enemy: The Primid. Its name implies that its meant to resemble
                something extraterrestial and other worldly. Perhaps something similar to the game's final boss, Tabuu?
