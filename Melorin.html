                With its name being the exact same in japanese, there is a lot to be gained from this name alone. The 'melo'part could
                mean either 'Melody' or 'Melancholy'. The rin is even more vague. It could elude to the sound of ringing. It could be
                a way to make it seem like a majestic creature. One could definitively say it was a ghastly figure that utilizes sound.
