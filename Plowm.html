                "Blowm" and "Plowm" were both found by each other within the code. This would imply that the two were going to be a
                pair within the game. Their names were practically the same in japanese, so nothing new can be deducted from that. I
                could imagine that they were mechanical in form and had the look of a wind blowing device and a pushing device.
